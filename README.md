# Coursera-Reproducible-data---Project-1

This is a reprository for a project within Coursera's Repoducible Research course.

NOTE TO READER/APPRAISER: I couldn't get the .md file to show all the plots, only two out of five, I tried everything. It runs perfect in original RStudio .rmd file and after knitr to .html, but for some reason some plots are not shown in Github. But they are all there as .png files, along with all the scripts visible in all three files. Thanks in advance for understanding!
